# PhotosCompSync

PhotoCompSync is a little script used to do a two-way synchronisation of photos. The goal is that one side has low resolution pictures and the other keep the original picture.

Storage on our beloved laptop is scarce. With pictures size becoming bigger and bigger, and due to the fact that we take more and more pictures, it becomes impossible to keep all of them on our laptop. The solution taken by most people is to store them on an external hard drive. This solution comes at a cost: you don't always have your pictures with you anymore. 

This solution allows you to keep a low resolution picture on your laptop while keeping the orginial files on your hard drive. 
Thanks to the bidirectional synchronisation, once you have new pictures, you can store them wherever you want on your local disk. Once you run the script, those pictures will be moved to the external hard drive and a low-resolution copy will be placed on your local hard drive.

## How to run

```
python -m pip install pillow
```
